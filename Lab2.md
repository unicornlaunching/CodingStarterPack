# now you have the power of memory
# can there be thought without memory? it's an interesting paradox
# you have the power of memory because you have memorized or stored five things inside a grocery_list

# having memory is one thing; remembering is another
# how might we remember things in code once we've stored them?

# we can display an item in our grocery list like this
